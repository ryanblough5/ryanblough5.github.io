<h3>Enhancement 1</h3>
  <p>This artifact was for CS360 course. The goal was to create a simple app, I chose to create a calendar app. It was created in April of 2025. I selected this item because it shows my
  skills in scripting with Java, and being able to design an app using Android Studio from scratch. It showcases my ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, 
  written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contents. It also demonstrates my ability to use well-founded
  and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the pupose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I imporved
  the artifact by making it look more realistic, by adding an icon at the top, a background, adjusting some of the fonts and adding a number of other things to make it look more viusally
  appealing.</p>
