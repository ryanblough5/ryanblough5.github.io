  <h2>CS-499 ePortfolio</h2>
<h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
  <p>Over the last two and half years at SNHU, I have learned a great deal. When I started, I was not familiar with any type of coding, now I feel confident in Python, C++, and Java. 
  There are many different experiences and learning experiences that I have learned to value over the course of the program. There were difficulties that I had to overcome and then there 
  were accomplishments that I am very proud of. One of my favorite moments was taking CS330: Computational Graphics and Visualization, where I created a passable representation of Michigan
  Stadium, where the Michigan Wolverines play football on Saturdays. I feel that Junit testing and database structuring has become like a second nature to me. But, I feel that my biggest 
  accomplishment of all is the steps I’ve taken to be able to develop code at a high level, I feel that when I take on a coding project my code is secure but not overly so where it 
  basically unusable and that I am able to use the industry-best practices to simplify it, so that it easily readable to everyone.</p>
  
  <p>I feel as though I have learned to be able to collaborate with other people and use teamwork though the hundreds of discussion boards that I have participated in and am willing to help
  in any way that I can. I have become very proficient on structuring data and algorithms through a series of databases and industry-best practices throughout my coding. I have become 
  experienced in being able to allow my programs to communicate with each other so that my code is structured and not overbearing, allowing some things to happen in the background while
  interacting with the user on the frontend of the program. I have utilized MongoDB exclusively, to set up a database and being able to access it, allowing me to adjust the appropriate
  files within the database, whether it’s updating, removing, adding, etc. I am able to maintain the database and manipulate it to my will. Security I believe is my strongest skill that
  I’ve developed over the course of the program. I believe that I have mastered the ability to securely code my programs without it being unbearable to the point where it is difficult to 
  use it.</p>
  
  <p>The three artifacts that I selected was a course that utilized Android Studio to create a calendar app where I was able to add and remove events from the calendar that would notify a 
  user, a series of Junit tests through Visual Studio that allowed the user to be secure and make sure that there were no vulnerabilities in a series of code, and lastly utilizing Jupyter
  Notebook using the CRUD method to add/edit/delete information from a stored database on MongoDB. I am now confident in my abilities that I have learned over my time at SNHU and look 
  forward to the future where I can grow my career and skillset.</p>
<h3>Enhancement 1</h3>
  <p>This artifact was for CS360 course. The goal was to create a simple app, I chose to create a calendar app. It was created in April of 2025. I selected this item because it shows my
  skills in scripting with Java, and being able to design an app using Android Studio from scratch. It showcases my ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, 
  written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contents. It also demonstrates my ability to use well-founded
  and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the pupose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I imporved
  the artifact by making it look more realistic, by adding an icon at the top, a background, adjusting some of the fonts and adding a number of other things to make it look more viusally
  appealing.</p>

<h3>Enhancement 2</h3>
  <p>This artifact is a series of unit test that test the security of a collection and verifies that when a test is supposed to fail, it does. It acts as a simulation of a real world
  scenario where a security system will allow access or deny access if certain criteria are met. It was created in April of 2025 as well. I selected this artifact beacause it shows my
  ability to add security to a system without allowing it to give access to someone who is not supposed to have it. The components that showcase my skills are the numberous tests that are
  performed throughout the process. The artifact is improved because I added and edited the code to perform more tests than I originally added. By doing this the code and system are even
  more secure, because of the tests that were added and/or edited. I learned that I could essentially add as many tests taht I wanted to without the program being interrupted. I feel as
  though the tests that I added, have my basis covered in a way where I can confidentally say that the security is in a place where the program simulation is secure. Some challenges
  that I faced was finding a way to get the code to assert at times, but after some maneuvering I was able to find the correct way to program it.</p>

<h3>Enhancement 3</h3>
  <p>This artifact is a database that is stored in MongoDB, which uitlizes the CRUD method to create, read, update and delete documents in the database. It was created in February of 2025
  for CS340 course. I selected this artifact because it shows my ability to maintain and manipulate a database. It showcases my ability to use the CRUD method, to which I have explained
  it to be able to create more than one document at a time, to update more than one document at a time, to delete more than one document at a time and I have also added the replace
  functions which would allow me to replace a single or multiple documents from within the database. I learned how to expand on my existing knowledge of the CRUD method, and I have improved
  the code from where it was when I first wrote it to be more functional with the use of if-statements and the try-except blocks. I believe that making those changes from the oringinal code
  created a more readable and effective code than my first attempt.</p>

<h3>Code Review</h3>
  <p>For my capstone, I created a code review for all three of my artifacts. 
  The following link will bring up my channel with the videos on YouTube: <a href="https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UCZP9HMRK1ob1OdagnO3TkMw/videos/upload?filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D">Code Review</a></p>
