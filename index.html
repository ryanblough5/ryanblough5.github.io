<h3>Enhancement 1</h3>
  <p>This artifact was for CS360 course. The goal was to create a simple app, I chose to create a calendar app. It was created in April of 2025. I selected this item because it shows my
  skills in scripting with Java, and being able to design an app using Android Studio from scratch. It showcases my ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, 
  written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contents. It also demonstrates my ability to use well-founded
  and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the pupose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. I imporved
  the artifact by making it look more realistic, by adding an icon at the top, a background, adjusting some of the fonts and adding a number of other things to make it look more viusally
  appealing.</p>

<h3>Enhancement 2</h3>
  <p>This artifact is a series of unit test that test the security of a collection and verifies that when a test is supposed to fail, it does. It acts as a simulation of a real world
  scenario where a security system will allow access or deny access if certain criteria are met. It was created in April of 2025 as well. I selected this artifact beacause it shows my
  ability to add security to a system without allowing it to give access to someone who is not supposed to have it. The components that showcase my skills are the numberous tests that are
  performed throughout the process. The artifact is improved because I added and edited the code to perform more tests than I originally added. By doing this the code and system are even
  more secure, because of the tests that were added and/or edited. I learned that I could essentially add as many tests taht I wanted to without the program being interrupted. I feel as
  though the tests that I added, have my basis covered in a way where I can confidentally say that the security is in a place where the program simulation is secure. Some challenges
  that I faced was finding a way to get the code to assert at times, but after some maneuvering I was able to find the correct way to program it.</p>

<h3>Enhancement 3</h3>
  <p>This artifact is a database that is stored in MongoDB, which uitlizes the CRUD method to create, read, update and delete documents in the database. It was created in February of 2025
  for CS340 course. I selected this artifact because it shows my ability to maintain and manipulate a database. It showcases my ability to use the CRUD method, to which I have explained
  it to be able to create more than one document at a time, to update more than one document at a time, to delete more than one document at a time and I have also added the replace
  functions which would allow me to replace a single or multiple documents from within the database. I learned how to expand on my existing knowledge of the CRUD method, and I have improved
  the code from where it was when I first wrote it to be more functional with the use of if-statements and the try-except blocks. I believe that making those changes from the oringinal code
  created a more readable and effective code than my first attempt.</p>
